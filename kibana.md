# KIBANA

- Kibana is an open `source browser based visualization tool mainly used to analyse large volume of logs` in the form of line graph, bar graph, pie charts , heat maps, region maps, coordinate maps, gauge, goals, timelion etc.
- The visualization makes it easy to `predict or to see the changes in trends of errors or other significant events of the input source`.
- Kibana `works in sync with Elasticsearch and Logstash` which together forms the so called ELK stack.
