# KIBANA

- Kibana is an open `source browser based visualization tool mainly used to analyse large volume of logs` in the form of line graph, bar graph, pie charts , heat maps, region maps, coordinate maps, gauge, goals, timelion etc.
- The visualization makes it easy to `predict or to see the changes in trends of errors or other significant events of the input source`.
- Kibana `works in sync with Elasticsearch and Logstash` which together forms the so called ELK stack.

## What is ELK Stack?

1. ELK stands for Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana
2. ELK is one of the popular `log management platform used worldwide for log analysis`.
3. In the ELK stack, `Logstash extracts the logging data or other events from different input sources`.
4. It processes the events and later `stores them in Elasticsearch`.
5. `Kibana` is a `visualization tool`, which accesses the logs from Elasticsearch and is able to display to the user in the form of line graph, bar graph, pie charts etc.
